Dreamcat - The ScummVM Dreamcast Adventure Game
===============================================

This is a 320x240 adventure game, with 8-bit resources optimized for ScummVM for Dreamcast.

It is intended to be a template for anyone to create their own adventures to run on the Dreamcast (or any platform that ScummVM supports).

This project uses the Wintermute engine by dead:code.

It is being optimized for use with the Wintermute engine in ScummVM, which was developed by somaen, t0by, and the ScummVM team (the version that is bundled with the WIP snapshots of this game is 1.8.1, unmodified).
